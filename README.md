# ðŸ¦† Swift Extensions

## ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

While working on projects I often stop and think: "I might need this later." Whenever that happens, I try to turn that particular piece of code into an Extension. This repo will be a place to store them all.

## ðŸš€ [FirstLaunch](https://github.com/JillevdW/Swift-Extensions/blob/master/FirstLaunch/README.md)
A UserDefaults extension to check if it's the first launch and to process that response.
